# spore_trap_information_theory

This folder is dedicated to work Neil McRoberts and I (Robin Choudhury) did in regards to analyzing spore trap data using an information theoretic approach, including exploring phase diagrams, average mutual information, and different metrics of entropy over the time series. This work is under consideration in the journal Entropy (circa 2020-10-09).
